# 🚀 Fine-Tuning a Text Classifier with BERT

This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune a **BERT-based text classification model** using the Hugging Face `transformers` library. The model is trained on a labeled dataset to predict class categories for given text inputs.

## 🛠️ Setup
- ✅ Loads the necessary libraries (`transformers`, `torch`, `datasets`).
- ✅ Checks for GPU availability to accelerate training.

## 📚 Dataset Preparation
- ✅ Loads and preprocesses a **text classification dataset**.
- ✅ Tokenizes input text using a **BERT tokenizer**.
- ✅ Splits the dataset into **training and validation** sets.

## 🎯 Model Fine-Tuning
- ✅ Loads a **pretrained multilingual BERT model**.
- ✅ Configures **training hyperparameters**:
  - Learning rate
  - Batch size
  - Number of epochs
- ✅ Implements **gradient accumulation** and **mixed precision training** for efficiency.

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- ✅ Evaluates the fine-tuned model on the validation set.
- ✅ Computes **accuracy and loss metrics**.

## 💾 Saving the Fine-Tuned Model
- ✅ Saves the **model weights, tokenizer, and configuration** for future inference.

## 🔍 Testing the Model
- ✅ Runs sample text through the model.
- ✅ Outputs **predicted class labels** for given text inputs.

## 🎯 Conclusion
This notebook provides a **step-by-step guide** to fine-tuning a **multilingual BERT classifier**. The resulting model is capable of **accurate text classification** and can be further optimized for deployment.

🚀 *Ideal for NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, topic classification, and intent recognition!*
